About pygame
============

     Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to
     write multimedia software, such as games, in Python. Pygame
     requires the Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can
     also make use of several other popular libraries.

Installation
============

     You should definitely begin by installing a binary package for your
     system. The binary packages usually come with or give the
     information needed for dependencies. Choose an appropriate
     installer for your system and version of python from the pygame
     downloads page. http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

     Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will
     involve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies. Once
     that is done run the "setup.py" script which will attempt to
     auto-configure, build, and install pygame.

     Much more information about installing and compiling is available
     in the install.html file.
