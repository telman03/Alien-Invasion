Help

If you are just getting started with pygame, you should be able to
get started fairly quickly.  Pygame comes with many tutorials and
introductions.  There is also full reference documentation for the
entire library. Browse the documentation on the `docs page`_.

The online documentation stays up to date with the development version
of pygame on github.  This may be a bit newer than the version of pygame
you are using. To upgrade to the latest full release, run 
``pip install pygame --upgrade`` in your terminal.

Best of all, the examples directory has many playable small programs
which can get you started playing with the code right away.


Building From Source
--------------------

If you want to use features that are currently in development,
or you want to contribute to pygame, you will need to build pygame
locally from its source code, rather than pip installing it.

Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will
involve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies.  Once
that is done, run the ``setup.py`` script which will attempt to
auto-configure, build, and install pygame.

Much more information about installing and compiling is available
on the `Compilation wiki page`_.
